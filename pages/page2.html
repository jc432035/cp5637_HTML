				<p> About Us SnapFine247 is specifically designed so that people will feel at ease exercising.We are not a body building gym. Our gyms are designed to help people lose weight & tone up and to increase their strength and cardiac conditioning.
				As many of our members are new to the gym scene we also offer No Lock-in Contract options so that they can determine their commitment to exercise without being locked in to a long term.</p>
					</p>
					<p>SnapFitness opened its first club in 2002 with the vision of providing a family friendly environment where every person can achieve a healthy lifestyle. At SnapFitness we pride ourselves in having a friendly team of trained professionals, to help our members in achieving their health and fitness goals.</p.
					><p>It’s not what we do, it’s why we do it – that’s our mantra and we live by it! We believe in our values – Teamwork, Dependability, Integrity, Responsibility, Compassion.</p>
